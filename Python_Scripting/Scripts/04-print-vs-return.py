# Difference between print and return
# The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.
# The return statement is used to exit a function and go back to the place from where it was called.
# The return statement is used when a function is ready to return a value to its caller.
# The return statement can contain an expression that gets evaluated and the value is returned.
# The return statement can be used to return multiple values from a function.
# Example:
def my_function():
    return 10

print('my_function:', my_function())
# Output: my_function: 10
